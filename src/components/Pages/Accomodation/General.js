            For the convenience of the enthusiastic participants of PecFest, we here in the Hospitality
            Department of PecFest take it upon ourselves to provide you with a convenient stay place within
            the institute itself. Owing to the huge scale participation, we have established a set of
            procedural guidelines to help make the process seamless and without glitches.<br/><br/>
            NOTE:<br/>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Owing to a large number of requests for accommodation, we are bound to provide it
                    strictly on a shared basis.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You will be given accommodation only after it has been confirmed by the Hospitality Core
                    Group members of the festival, through the CL of your college.
